## How to run this app locally?
First things first, check if you have node server and npm package manager(I am guessing the name).

To check whether you got it, type into your command line:

`node --version` and `npm --version`

If both show you some funny numbers, it's ok -- you're ready to go.

### Ok, what's next, smartypants?
In order to run the app (bet you can't handle the tension now), you have to go into the project directory and type

`npm install` or `npm i`

This will install every package located in `package.json` file and create directory `node_modules/`.

After the installation is complete, you're finally ready to go!

### Geez, just tell me how to run the app
Ok, ok, hold your horses pardner, let's all calm down and type `npm start`

### That's it? Seriously all this trouble and disk space for one simple command?
Oof, okey dokey, pardon me, I forgot to mention a web service that hosts this app already
